The name's rather unimaginative, and this project does just what it says.

When it is given the word color, this is what it gives back: @collar coaler choler cooler caller cholera cellar collier celery calorie clear culler Clari Clary clawer chiller colliery Collier Clare Clair Clara Clarie Clarey clayier Claire clearway@

Rather nice, eh?

If you want this to use some other word list, you'll need to download a dictionary for it. Any '.dic' file from http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries should work. Open setup.rb, change en_US.dic to whatever is appropriate for the file you downloaded, and then run setup.rb. 

You could also create your own dictionary file. Just put each word on a new line. Anything after a '/' is ignored.
